# Troubleshooting

## Server Issues

### Server Shows Offline

**Symptoms:** Status shows 🔴 Offline

**Check:**

- Is CS2 server running?
- Is RCON password correct?
- Can API reach server on port 27015?
- Check firewall rules

**Fix:**

1. Verify server is running
2. Test RCON: `rcon_address IP:27015; rcon_password PASSWORD; rcon status`
3. Click "Check Status" to refresh
4. Reconfigure server with correct RCON password

### Match Won't Load

**Symptoms:** "Failed to load match" error

**Check:**

- Is server status "Online"?
- Is MatchZy plugin loaded? (`css_plugins list`)
- Can server reach API for webhook?

**Fix:**

1. Verify MatchZy installed
2. Check server console for errors
3. Try manual RCON: `matchzy_loadmatch_url https://...`
4. Restart CS2 server if needed

### Events Not Arriving

**Symptoms:** No real-time updates, player connections not showing

**Check:**

- CS2 console: `[MatchZy] Remote log sent: ...`
- API console for events
- Webhook configuration
- SERVER_TOKEN matches

**Fix:**

1. Check CS2 can reach API (from your CS2 server):
   - Docker: `curl http://192.168.1.50:3069/api/events/test`
   - Local dev: `curl http://192.168.1.50:3000/api/events/test`
2. Verify `matchzy_remote_log_url` is set correctly
3. Verify `matchzy_remote_log_header_value` matches SERVER_TOKEN
4. Click "Check Status" to reconfigure webhooks
5. Check firewall allows inbound on port **3069** (Docker) or **3000** (local dev)

## Match Issues

### Player Can't Connect

**Symptoms:** "Auth rejected" or similar

**Fix:**

1. Verify Steam ID is correct
2. Add as backup player:
   - Match Details → Player Management
   - Search player, select team, add
3. Ensure `get5_check_auths true` is set

### Veto Not Starting

**Symptoms:** No "Start Veto" button on team page

**Check:**

- Is tournament started?
- Is match format BO1/BO3/BO5?
- Is match status "ready"?

**Fix:**

1. Verify tournament is in "In Progress" state
2. Refresh team page
3. If stuck, admin can skip veto

### Match Stuck in Warmup

**Symptoms:** Waiting for players, but all are connected

**Check:**

- Are all players actually ready? (typed `.ready`)
- Are there 10/10 players?

**Fix:**

1. Check player roster for who's not ready
2. Ask players to type `.ready`
3. Or force start: Admin Controls → End Warmup

### Scores Not Updating

**Symptoms:** Live scores not changing

**Check:**

- Are events arriving? (check API logs)
- Is WebSocket connected? (check browser console)

**Fix:**

1. Refresh page
2. Check server events endpoint
3. Verify match is actually live on server

## Bracket Issues

### Winner Not Advancing

**Symptoms:** Match complete but bracket not updating

**Fix:**

1. Verify match status is "completed"
2. Check winner is set correctly
3. Manually set winner if needed:
   - Click match in bracket
   - Set Winner → Select team
4. Refresh bracket page

### Team Shows as "TBD"

**Symptoms:** Team slot shows "TBD" instead of team name

**Explanation:** Normal - waiting for previous match

**Fix:**

- Previous match must complete first
- Winner auto-fills the slot

## Network Issues

### API Server Unreachable

**Symptoms:** CS2 servers can't send webhooks

**Fix:**

1. Test API is reachable (from CS2 server):
   - Docker: `curl http://192.168.1.50:3069/api/events/test`
   - Local dev: `curl http://192.168.1.50:3000/api/events/test`
2. Check firewall allows inbound on port **3069** (Docker) or **3000** (local dev)
3. Verify the webhook URL in the dashboard **Settings** matches your setup:
   - Docker: typically `https://your-domain.com`
   - Local dev: `http://your-ip:3000`
4. Use IP address instead of hostname if DNS issues

### CS2 Server Unreachable

**Symptoms:** Can't send RCON commands

**Fix:**

1. Check server is running
2. Verify port 27015 is open
3. Test from API server: `nc -zv server-ip 27015`
4. Check RCON password is correct

## Docker Issues

### Container Won't Start

**Fix:**

```bash
# Check logs
docker compose logs api

# Common issues:
# - Port already in use: change PORT environment variable
# - Database connection issues: check DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME env vars
# - Missing environment variables: ensure SERVER_TOKEN and DB_* vars are set
```

### Can't Access from Other Machines

**Fix:**

```bash
# Ensure ports are exposed
docker compose ps

# Should show 0.0.0.0:3069->3069
# If not, check docker compose.yml ports section
```

## General Tips

### Enable Debug Logging

```bash
# Set environment variables
export LOG_LEVEL=debug
export NODE_ENV=development
```

Restart API to see detailed logs.

### Check Browser Console

Press F12 in browser, check Console tab for:

- WebSocket connection errors
- API request failures
- JavaScript errors

### Verify Environment

```bash
# Check all services
docker compose ps  # All should be "Up"

# Check API health
curl http://localhost:3069/api/events/test

# Check CS2 server
rcon_address IP:27015
rcon_password PASSWORD
rcon status
```

### Clean Slate Restart

If all else fails:

```bash
# Restart everything
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build

# Or without Docker:
yarn build
yarn start
```

## Advanced Setup

### Build from Source

If you've cloned the repository and want to build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sivert-io/matchzy-auto-tournament.git
cd matchzy-auto-tournament
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.local.yml up -d --build
```

### Local Development (without Docker)

For development with hot-reload:

```bash
# Install all dependencies for API and client (Yarn workspaces)
yarn install

# Start PostgreSQL (or use your own)
yarn db

# Set environment variables
export SERVER_TOKEN=your-server-token
export DB_HOST=localhost
export DB_PORT=5432
export DB_USER=postgres
export DB_PASSWORD=postgres
export DB_NAME=matchzy_tournament

# Start in dev mode (API + client)
yarn dev
```

**Frontend:** `http://localhost:5173`  
**API:** `http://localhost:3000`

**Configure Webhook URL:**

When you start the dev server, you'll see output like:

```
[CLIENT]   VITE v5.4.21  ready in 450 ms
[CLIENT]
[CLIENT]   ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
[CLIENT]   ➜  Network: http://192.168.2.5:5173/
[CLIENT]   ➜  Network: http://100.110.237.14:5173/
[CLIENT]   ➜  Network: http://192.168.10.158:5173/
```

1. Go to **Settings** in the dashboard
2. Set the **Webhook URL** to the API endpoint:
   - **If CS2 servers are on the same machine:** `http://localhost:3000`
   - **If CS2 servers are on the network:** Use one of the Network IPs shown above, but change the port to `3000` (e.g., `http://192.168.2.5:3000`)
   - Use whichever IP your CS2 servers can reach
3. Click **"Save Settings"**

> **Note:** The frontend runs on port `5173`, but webhooks must point to the API on port `3000`.

### Docker Architecture

The Docker setup uses Caddy as a reverse proxy:

- Frontend app at `/` (root)
- API at `/api`
- Everything runs on port **3069** — just expose this single port for production

**Multi-Architecture Support:**

- `amd64` / `x86_64` (Intel/AMD 64-bit)
- `arm64` / `aarch64` (ARM 64-bit, e.g., Apple Silicon, Raspberry Pi 4+)
- `armv7` / `armv6` (ARM 32-bit, e.g., older Raspberry Pi)

### Network Configuration

**Private Network (LAN):**

- Everything on `192.168.x.x` - works out of the box
- Share team pages with local IPs

**Public Internet:**

- Get a domain or use public IP
- Expose/proxy port **3069** only
- Set webhook base URL in **Settings** to your public domain

**Recommended:** Run on private network, expose via reverse proxy if needed.
